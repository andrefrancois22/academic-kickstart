I completed my Ph.D. in Thomas Griffithsâ€™ [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/) formerly at [UC Berkeley](https://psychology.berkeley.edu) in August of 2018. Prior to completing my Ph.D., I completed an M.S. in Computer Science (EECS), also at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu). I am currently at [Princeton University](https://psych.princeton.edu) working as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/). My research interests center around uncovering the structure of human perceptual priors and understanding the role that they play in perception and cognition.
